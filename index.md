DCRA is the District of Columbia's regulatory agency. DCRA's mission is to protect the health, safety, economic interests, and quality of life of residents, businesses, and visitors in the District of Columbia by issuing licenses and permits, conducting inspections, enforcing building, housing, and safety codes, regulating land use and development, and providing consumer education and advocacy services. 

DCRA supports a thriving community of residents, businesses, and visitors through diligent protection of health and safety and equitable administration of regulation and compliance in our District. 

DCRA has been growing at a record pace, and so has the demand for required inspections by the agency. DCRA is embracing alternative solutions that will decrease the wait in scheduling and reduce the inefficiencies of existing solutions. Currently, there are 68 full-time inspectors, and the forecast for demand is approaching 150,000 inspections per year.

_EastBanc Technologies will provide DCRA with implementation and integration services to enhance and automate the inspection management and scheduling process._

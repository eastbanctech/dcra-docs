# On Duty and Off Duty
Inspectors have the ability to use the Dispatch app while both on duty and off duty, with difference in mode, Active vs. Inactive. 

<section id="on-duty" markdown="1">

## On Duty
Once logged in, Inspectors see a popup, that allows them to indicate their on duty status so that their location can be reported to DCRA.

### Schedule in Active Mode

By selecting On Duty button, the Schedule triggers Active mode, where Inspectors can interact with assignments and add Absences.

## Switching Between Off Duty and On Duty

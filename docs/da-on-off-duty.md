# On Duty and Off Duty
Users have the ability to use the Dispatch app while both on duty and off duty. 

<section id="on-duty" markdown="1">

## On Duty
Once the Inspector logs in, a popup message appears on the screen.

By selecting On Duty button, the app displays an active Schedule and current Assignment page.

## Off Duty

However, if the Inspector selects the "Not Now" button, the App allows the Inspector to view the Schedule and Assignment page, but not to work on any assignments. Inspectors cannot work on assignments when they are Off Duty and therefore the Schedule and Assignment pages are greyed out and are inactive.

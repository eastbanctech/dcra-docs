# Working with Assignments

When you finish inspecting, switch to the CityGov App and locate the assignment (by its Accela number) and click on Perform Inspection.

 **NOTE:** _Keep in mind that the CityGov app saves the data locally and therefore even if the connection is lost, the inspection can and must continue to be performed. Being offline doesn't mean the app isn't working. The app will sync the data once it comes back online_

The assignment status will be displayed as Completed and system will display the next assignment (if any) and if there is no assignment, the No Assignment page will be displayed. If the Assignment wasn't completed in Accela, the Dispatch app will not allow you to proceed and you must return to CityGov to resolve the Inspection there first.

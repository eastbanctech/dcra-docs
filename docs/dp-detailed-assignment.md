### Completed Assignments <sup class="new">NEW</sup>

When an assignment is completed (resulted in DCRA Mobile Inspection App or Accela), additional details are added to the Assignment details page. Users can no longer cancel or reschedule the assignment. 

Completed assignments display the result of the inspection in Accela. The results are displayed under the column Accela Data.

Additionally, if a completed assignment requires a follow-up inspection the information will be provided via the Accela Data column.  The Accela Data column will either display the date the follow-up will be created or a link to the follow-up inspection.
